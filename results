# Chess.com Performance Analysis – Last 100 Games

##Project Summary
This project analyzes my last 100 games on Chess.com to explore the relationship between factors like rating difference, color, and time control — and how they impact my win rate.

##Player
**Username:** `samuraibartu`

##Hypothesis
> I am more likely to win when my rating is higher than my opponent's.

##Methods
- Data collected via [Chess.com Public API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)
- Cleaned and transformed using Python and pandas
- Feature Engineering:
  - `Rating Diff` (My Rating − Opponent Rating)
  - `Win` column (1 for win, 0 otherwise)
  - `Color`, `Time Control`, etc.
- Visualized using seaborn and matplotlib
- Hypothesis tested using independent two-sample t-test

##Files Included
- `last_100_chess_games.json` — Raw data from Chess.com
- `cleaned_chess_data.csv` — Cleaned and enriched dataset
- `analysis.py` — Full analysis pipeline
- `win_rate_by_color.png` — Win rate comparison by color
- `rating_diff_distribution.png` — Rating difference histogram
- `win_rate_by_time_control.png` — Performance by time control

##Results
- Win rate is **statistically higher** when my rating is greater than opponent's  
- **P-value:** 0.0166 → significant at 95% confidence
- Slightly better performance as **Black**
- Majority of games were **blitz** format with `180+2` control

##Machine Learning Model Comparison
We evaluated three classification models to predict game outcomes based on rating difference and other features:

| Model                | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 60%      |
| Decision Tree        | 65%      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors  | 75%      |

The K-Nearest Neighbors model outperformed the others, suggesting that local patterns in the data are significant predictors of game outcomes.

##Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scipy.stats for statistical testing

##Conclusion
The analysis confirms that rating difference is a significant predictor of game outcomes. The K-Nearest Neighbors model achieved the highest accuracy, indicating that local patterns in player ratings are influential. Future work could explore additional features such as opening strategies or time controls to further improve predictive performance.
