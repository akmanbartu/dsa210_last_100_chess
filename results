# Chess.com Performance Analysis – Last 100 Games

##Project Summary
This project analyzes my last 100 games on Chess.com to explore the relationship between factors like rating difference, color, and time control — and how they impact my win rate.

##Player
**Username:** `samuraibartu`

##Hypothesis
> I am more likely to win when my rating is higher than my opponent's.

##Methods
- Data collected via [Chess.com Public API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)
- Cleaned and transformed using Python and pandas
- Feature Engineering:
  - `Rating Diff` (My Rating − Opponent Rating)
  - `Win` column (1 for win, 0 otherwise)
  - `Color`, `Time Control`, etc.
- Visualized using seaborn and matplotlib
- Hypothesis tested using independent two-sample t-test

##Files Included
- `last_100_chess_games.json` — Raw data from Chess.com
- `cleaned_chess_data.csv` — Cleaned and enriched dataset
- `analysis.py` — Full analysis pipeline
- `win_rate_by_color.png` — Win rate comparison by color
- `rating_diff_distribution.png` — Rating difference histogram
- `win_rate_by_time_control.png` — Performance by time control

##Results
- Win rate is **statistically higher** when my rating is greater than opponent's  
- **P-value:** 0.0166 → significant at 95% confidence
- Slightly better performance as **Black**
- Majority of games were **blitz** format with `180+2` control

##Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scipy.stats for statistical testing

##Conclusion
The data supports the hypothesis — higher rating gives a statistically significant edge in games. Time control and color also show trends, but need more data for stronger conclusions.
