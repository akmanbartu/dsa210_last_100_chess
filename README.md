# dsa210_last_100_chess_games
For DSA210 course, i will collect data from chess.com for my previous 100 chess games and prepare my project accordingly.

**Hypothesis**

Null Hyphothesis(H0): There is no significant relationship between the rating difference (my rating minus my opponent's rating) and my likelihood of winning. My win rate remains consistent regardless of the rating gap.

Alternative Hypothesis(H1): There is a significant relationship between the rating difference and my likelihood of winning. As the rating gap increases in my favor, my win rate increases, and as the rating gap decreases (or becomes negative), my win rate decreases.

**Abstarct**

This project aims to investigate the relationship between various internal and external factors and my chess performance on Chess.com. By analyzing my last 100 games, I will explore potential correlations between game outcomes and factors such as starting color, opponent rating differences, and opponent geographical location. The study will involve data extraction, preprocessing, and statistical analysis using Python. The findings will provide insights into patterns affecting my gameplay, helping optimize my playing strategy and schedule.

**Project Proposal**

This project aims to analyze the correlation between various external and internal factors and my chess performance based on my last 100 games on Chess.com. By collecting and analyzing relevant data, I will explore potential relationships that influence my gameplay outcomes.

**Data Collection**

The dataset will be sourced from my Chess.com account and will include my last 100 games. The data will be extracted with API. The data points to be collected include:

Opponent's rating

Opponent's country

Game result (win, loss, draw)

Color played (white or black)

Time control of the game

**Analysis Plan**

I will investigate the following potential correlations:

Starting color vs. win rate – Analyzing whether I have a higher win rate as White or Black.

Opponent rating difference vs. game outcome – Examining how my performance is affected when facing higher or lower-rated opponents.

Opponent's country/region vs. performance – Evaluating if my win rate varies based on my opponent’s geographic location.

**Implementation Plan**

Extract relevant game data from Chess.com

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Perform statistical correlation analysis using Python

Interpret results and provide insights.

**Expected Outcome**

This project will provide insights into factors that influence my chess performance, helping me understand my strengths and weaknesses. The findings could also be used to optimize my playing schedule and strategy.
