Chess Performance Correlation Analysis

**Project Proposal**

This project aims to analyze the correlation between various external and internal factors and my chess performance based on my last 100 games on Chess.com. By collecting and analyzing relevant data, I will explore potential relationships that influence my gameplay outcomes.

**Data Collection**

The dataset will be sourced from my Chess.com account and will include my last 100 games. The data points to be collected include:

Opponent's rating

Opponent's country

Game result (win, loss, draw)

Color played (white or black)

Time control of the game

**Analysis Plan**

I will investigate the following potential correlations:

Starting color vs. win rate – Analyzing whether I have a higher win rate as White or Black.

Opponent rating difference vs. game outcome – Examining how my performance is affected when facing higher or lower-rated opponents.

Opponent's country/region vs. performance – Evaluating if my win rate varies based on my opponent’s geographic location.

**Implementation Plan**

Extract relevant game data from Chess.com

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Perform statistical correlation analysis using Python

Interpret results and provide insights.

**Expected Outcome**

This project will provide insights into factors that influence my chess performance, helping me understand my strengths and weaknesses. The findings could also be used to optimize my playing schedule and strategy.
